# How to get the correct logo image URL.

When you need to get the image URL for a logo, make sure that you have the correct URL, the one with 'raw' in the string. All logos are transparent PNG files. If you are not in dark mode in Github then you might sometimes not see the logo as it's white. Trust me its there, you can right click on it.

Follow these steps for an easy way of getting the working .png 'raw' url.

Extra Notes:
1. The URL for the page of a logo is not the image URL. Although it looks like the image URL because of the .png ending, its not. Do not use this URL if you want to link to the image URL. This is IMPORTANT!
 
2. There more ways of getting a working image URL. By right clicking on the logo and choose 'copy image address', this is the quickest and easiest way. But the image URL might not have full support. Experiment with this on your system. Entering this URL in an address bar and go will update the URL to a regular .png url with 100% support.
  
3. Another method is with right click on a logo and choose 'open image in new tab' and from the new tab copy the URL. This is similar to using the download button.
 
4. If a logo changes or needs update I will use the same link, so when I push out the update it should automatically update for you. If not then clear cache in your browser/restart device/app. Occasionally a link might go down or break, one cause would be a new name for channel or a change in naming logic. If your logo is not loading then probably the URL changed. If that happens then please go to the list and get the new URL.
