A digital on-screen graphic (originally known as digitally originated graphic,
and known in the UK and New Zealand by the acronym DOG; in the US, Canada,
Ireland and Australia as a bug or network bug) is a watermark-like station
logo that most television broadcasters overlay over a portion of the screen
area of their programs to identify the channel. They are thus a form of permanent
visual station identification, increasing brand recognition and asserting
ownership of the video signal. In some cases, the graphic also shows the name
of the current program.
